I started playing a [Dungeons and Dragons](http://dnd.wizards.com/) 5e campaign with a few of my friends. 
One of my favorite aspects of the game was creating random encounters to help tell the story. 
Weâ€™re currently using [Roll20](https://roll20.net) to run our games since we live remote from each other. 
The program also allows us to design interesting maps and mechanics macros.   
   
One thing that I wanted to do was create a consistency between the tokens we use. 
I also wanted a style that could differentiate between friend and foe. 
I designed a reusable token svg that I have been using for our NPCs, PCs, and Foes.

Here are some of the tokens I'm using in my current game.
