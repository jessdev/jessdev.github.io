I recently started playing a [Dungeons and Dragons](http://dnd.wizards.com/) 5e campaign with a few of my friends on [Roll20](https://roll20.net).
Originally we started with the "Storm King Thunder" but quickly found that we just weren't having much fun with the story line.    

The parts we did have fun with were when I went off script and randomly generated encounters that could integrate into the story.
It was painfully obvious that the random encounters weren't part of the story due to the inconsistency of the token design. 
I couldnâ€™t replicated the tokens we had been using so I decided to design my own.      
    
I took several aspects of the old tokens and tried to expand on them while adding in my own tastes. I use three different color schemes to differentiate between party members, clear enemies, and impartial NPCs. I used [inscape]( https://inkscape.org) to create the token templates.

Here are some of the tokens I'm using in my current game:
