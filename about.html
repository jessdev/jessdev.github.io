<p>I graduated form the University of Michigan as a Chemical Engineer. I worked in the lab as researcher support, building small scripts to help with the research. I ended going into software development instead and I haven't turned back.</p>
<p>I have worked on everything to web applications to scripts to enterprise desktop applications. I primarily work on web applications. My current goal is to try out react.</p>
