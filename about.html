<p>I graduated form the University of Michigan as a Chemical Engineer. I worked in the lab as researcher support, building small scripts to help with day to day activities. I ended going into software development instead and I haven't turned back.</p>
<p>I have worked on everything to web applications to scripts to enterprise desktop applications. I primarily work on web applications but also have a ton of experience with C#.</p>
<p>My current goal on this site is to experiment with javascript frontend frameworks. I want to try builing out the same application with [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io/), [and Angular 2](https://angular.io/) not to find out which framework is the best but the one that works the best for me.</p>
